    Your challenge is to write a function that takes a list of integers and a target number.
    The function should return a list of pairs (as tuples) from the input list whose sum is equal to the target number.
    Each pair should be a tuple of two elements: the first element should be less than or equal to the second.
    If there are multiple pairs with the same pair of values, only include it once in your output.
    If there are no pairs that sum to the target, return an empty list.
